          Together, the Sun and the planets produced the solar nebula, a cloud of gas and dust, some 4.6 billion years ago. The collapse of the solar nebula was most likely caused by a shock wave from a nearby supernova explosion. The planets formed in a narrow disk circling the Sun, which formed at its core.
        </p>
        <p>
          Earth formed when gravity pulled swirling gas and dust in to become the third planet from the Sun.

              <p>
                Mercury is the smallest planet in our solar system and the closest to the Sun; it is little bigger than the moon. The Sun would appear more than three times as large and the sunlight up to seven times brighter from Mercury's surface than it does from Earth.

              <p>On Venus, a day lasts more than a year. Venus takes longer to complete one rotation on its axis than it does to complete one orbit around the Sun. To revolve once, that would take 243 Earth days.
