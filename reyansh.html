          Together, the Sun and the planets produced the solar nebula, a cloud of gas and dust, some 4.6 billion years ago. The collapse of the solar nebula was most likely caused by a shock wave from a nearby supernova explosion. The planets formed in a narrow disk circling the Sun, which formed at its core.
        </p>
        <p>
          Earth formed when gravity pulled swirling gas and dust in to become the third planet from the Sun.

                We launched freeCodeCamp with a simple list of 15 resources,
                including Harvard's CS50 and Stanford's Database Class.

            <li>
              <h4 class="list-subtitle">Venus</h4>
              <p>We added interactive algorithm challenges.</p>

              <h4 class="list-subtitle">Earth</h4>
              <p>
                We added our own HTML+CSS challenges (before we'd been relying on
                General Assembly's Dash course for these).

                We expanded the curriculum to 3 certifications, including Front
                End, Back End, and Data Visualization. They each had 10 required
                projects, but only the Front End section had its own challenges.
                For the other certs, we were still using external resources like
                Node School.

                We launched 6 new certifications to replace our old ones. This was
                the biggest curriculum improvement to date.
