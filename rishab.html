          <h3 class="list-title">What is Space Exploration?</h3>
          <p>Space exploration is the use of astronomy and space technology to explore outer space. While the exploration of space is currently carried out mainly by astronomers with telescopes, its physical exploration is conducted both by uncrewed robotic space probes and human spaceflight.</p>

              <h3 class="list-title">Humans in Space</h3>
          <p> Humans going to space helps address fundamental questions about our place in the universe and the history of our solar system. Yuri Gagarin from the Soviet Union was the first human in space. His vehicle, Vostok 1 circled Earth at a speed of 27,400 kilometers per hour with the flight lasting 108 minutes. Vostok's reentry was controlled by a computer.

          <h3 class="list-title">Future of Space Exploration</h3>
          <p>  NASAâ€™s future will continue to be a story of human exploration, technology, and science. We will go back to the Moon to learn more about what it will take to support human exploration to Mars and beyond. We will continue to nurture the development of a vibrant low-Earth orbit economy that builds on the work done to date by the International Space Station. NASA engineers will develop new technologies to improve air transport at home and meet the challenges of advanced space exploration. Our scientists will work to increase an understanding of our planet and our place in the universe

          <p>
            NASA's unique mission provides 
            benefits in big and small ways. 
            Dollars spent for space exploration 
            create jobs, jumpstart businesses, and 
            grow the economy. Our innovations improve 
            daily life, advance medical research, support 
            disaster response, and more.

            <h3 class="list-title">International Space Station</h3>
          <p> The ISS travels at about 17,500 miles/28,000 kilometers per hour. At this speed, the ISS orbits the Earth every 90 minutes, which gives the crew 16 sunrises and sunsets every day. Since humans have been living and working on the space station, it has orbited Earth tens of thousands of times.</p>
