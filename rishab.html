          <h3 class="list-title">What is Space Exploration?</h3>
          <p>Space exploration is the use of astronomy and space technology to explore outer space. While the exploration of space is currently carried out mainly by astronomers with telescopes, its physical exploration is conducted both by uncrewed robotic space probes and human spaceflight.</p>

              <h3 class="list-title">Humans in Space</h3>
          <p> Humans going to space helps address fundamental questions about our place in the universe and the history of our solar system. Yuri Gagarin from the Soviet Union was the first human in space. His vehicle, Vostok 1 circled Earth at a speed of 27,400 kilometers per hour with the flight lasting 108 minutes. Vostok's reentry was controlled by a computer.

          <p>
            NASA's unique mission provides 
            benefits in big and small ways. 
            Dollars spent for space exploration 
            create jobs, jumpstart businesses, and 
            grow the economy. Our innovations improve 
            daily life, advance medical research, support 
            disaster response, and more.

            <h3 class="list-title">International Space Station</h3>
          <p> The ISS travels at about 17,500 miles/28,000 kilometers per hour. At this speed, the ISS orbits the Earth every 90 minutes, which gives the crew 16 sunrises and sunsets every day. Since humans have been living and working on the space station, it has orbited Earth tens of thousands of times.</p>
