          The Universe is the great unknown. Everything we know about the universe is only from 5% of the universe. 95% of the universe is unknown and undiscovered.
        </p>
        <p>
          The universe is a vast and incomprehensible expanse that encompasses all of space, time, matter, and energy. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Sprawling across billions of light-years, it hosts an intricate dance of galaxies, stars, planets, and cosmic phenomena.

          From the microscopic particles to the colossal superclusters, the universe unfolds its mysteries through the laws of physics and the forces that govern celestial bodies.
        </p>
        <p>
          Its evolution spans epochs, marked by cosmic events and the continuos expansion of spacetime.
        </p>
        <p>
          As humanity endeavors to explore and understand this cosmic tapestry, the universe remains an awe-inspiring canvas of wonders, inviting contemplation of our place within its boundless reaches.

          <h3 class="list-title">A Brief History</h3>
          <p>Of the Curriculum</p>
          <ul class="lists">
            <li>
              <h4 class="list-subtitle">V1 - 2014</h4>
              <p>
                We launched freeCodeCamp with a simple list of 15 resources,
                including Harvard's CS50 and Stanford's Database Class.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4 class="list-subtitle">V2 - 2015</h4>
              <p>We added interactive algorithm challenges.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4 class="list-subtitle">V3 - 2015</h4>
              <p>
                We added our own HTML+CSS challenges (before we'd been relying on
                General Assembly's Dash course for these).
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4 class="list-subtitle">V4 - 2016</h4>
              <p>
                We expanded the curriculum to 3 certifications, including Front
                End, Back End, and Data Visualization. They each had 10 required
                projects, but only the Front End section had its own challenges.
                For the other certs, we were still using external resources like
                Node School.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4 class="list-subtitle">V5 - 2017</h4>
              <p>We added the back end and data visualization challenges.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4 class="list-subtitle">V6 - 2018</h4>
              <p>
                We launched 6 new certifications to replace our old ones. This was
                the biggest curriculum improvement to date.
