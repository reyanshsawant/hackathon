          The Universe is the great unknown. Everything we know about the universe is only from 5% of the universe. 95% of the universe is unknown and undiscovered.
        </p>
        <p>
          The universe is a vast and incomprehensible expanse that encompasses all of space, time, matter, and energy. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Sprawling across billions of light-years, it hosts an intricate dance of galaxies, stars, planets, and cosmic phenomena.

          From the microscopic particles to the colossal superclusters, the universe unfolds its mysteries through the laws of physics and the forces that govern celestial bodies.
        </p>
        <p>
          Its evolution spans epochs, marked by cosmic events and the continuos expansion of spacetime.
        </p>
        <p>
          As humanity endeavors to explore and understand this cosmic tapestry, the universe remains an awe-inspiring canvas of wonders, inviting contemplation of our place within its boundless reaches.

            <li>
              <h4 class="list-subtitle">Eratosthenes of Cyrene</h4>
              <p>
                A Greek astronomer and mathematician that used the Sun to measure the equatorial circumference of the round Earth at a time when most people believed the Earth was flat. His measurement of 24,660 miles was only 241 miles off from our modern calculations.

            </li>
            <li>
                <h4 class="list-subtitle">Nicolaus Copernicus</h4>
                <p>
                  A polish astronomer that proposed a model of the solar system that involved the Earth revolving around the sun. 
                </p>
              </li>
            <li>
              <h4 class="list-subtitle">Galileo Galilei</h4>
              <p>The Italian astronomer is often credited with the creation of the optical telescope, though in reality, he improved on existing models. Regardless, his invention led to various scientific advancements. He also famously proved that all falling bodies fall at the same rate regardless of mass. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4 class="list-subtitle">Isacc Newton</h4>
              <p>
                The English astronomer is most famous for his work on forces, specifically, gravity. He calculated three laws describing the motion of forces between objects, known today as Newton's laws. Newton is widely regarded as the most influential figure in all of science.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4 class="list-subtitle">Henrietta Swann Leavitt</h4>
              <p>
                As one of the most influential female astronomers of all time, Henrietta discovered that the brightness of a special flashing star known as a Cepheid variable was related to how often it pulsed. This relationship allowed astronomers to calculate the distances of stars and galaxies, the size of the Milky Way, and the expansion of the universe.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4 class="list-subtitle">Albert Einstein</h4>
              <p>The German physicist became one of the most famous scientists ever after proposing a new way of looking at the universe that went beyond current understanding. Einstein suggested that the laws of physics are the same throughout the universe, that the speed of light in a vacuum is constant, and that space and time are linked in an entity known as space-time, which is distorted by gravity.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4 class="list-subtitle">Edwin Hubble</h4>
              <p>
               The American astronomer calculated that a small blob in the sky existed outside of the Milky Way. Prior to his observations, the discussion over the size of the universe was divided as to whether or not only a single galaxy existed. Hubble went on to determine that the universe itself was expanding, a calculation which later came to be known as Hubble's law. Hubble's observations of the various galaxies allowed him to create a standard system of classification still used today.

            </li>
            <li>
                <h4 class="list-subtitle">Carl Sagan</h4>
                <p>
                  The American astronomer is one of the most famous astronsomers of all time for his contributions to the field of planetary science and his popularization of astronomy. His charismatic teaching and boundless energy influenced people around the world as he broke down complicated subjects in a way that interested television viewers even as he educated them. Sagan founded the Planetary Society, a nonprofit organization devoted to advancing space science and exploration. He published numerous articles and books, including "Cosmos," which became a television show viewed by a billion people in sixty countries.

              <li>
                <h4 class="list-subtitle">Stephen Hawking</h4>
                <p>
                  Regarded as one of the most brilliant minds since Einstein, Hawking made many significant insights into the field of cosmology. He proposed that, as the universe has a beginning, it will likely also end. He also suggested that it has no boundary or border. Hawking's primary discovery stated that since the universe began (at the Big Bang), it must come to an end. Hawking demonstrated (with Roger Penrose) that since Einstein’s general theory of relativity suggested that space and time began at the birth of the universe, and ends within black holes. This results unites general relativity and quantum theory. Further, Hawking predicted that black holes do emit radiation, called Hawking radiation.

                <h4 class="list-subtitle">Yuri Gagarin</h4>
                <p>
                  The Soviet Cosmonaut would take flight 203 miles above the Earth making him the first human to travel into space. His first words, the first ever spoken by a human in space, were, “I see the earth. It’s so beautiful!”

                <h4 class="list-subtitle">Neil Armstrong</h4>
                <p>
                    Neil Armstrong is arguably the most famous astronaut that ever lived. The Ohio-born astronaut became famous the world over in 1969 when he became the first man to walk on the moon. His iconic words, “that’s one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind,” are some of the most famous in history.

                <h4 class="list-subtitle">Alan Shepard</h4>
                <p>
                    Born in 1923, Nasa Astronaut Alan Shepard was the first American in space. After WWII, Alan Shepard went back to school and became a test pilot. He is famous for being one of only 12 individuals who also walked on the moon. Alan Shepard was involved in 2 space missions, and famously was the first person to hit a golf ball on the moon.

              <li>
                <h4 class="list-subtitle">Buzz Aldrin</h4>
                <p>
                    Nasa astronaut Buzz Aldrin isn’t as famous as his colleague Neil Armstrong, but anyone with even a passing interest in space exploration knows his name. He stepped onto the moon around twenty minutes after Armstrong during the famous Apollo 11 mission.
